    ### Question 01: In what areas is the Javascript programming language used ?

    <br>

    ```
        JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is 
        also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are 
        some basic things JavaScript is used for:

        1. Adding interactive behavior to web pages JavaScript allows users to interact with web
        pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page
        these are just a few examples:

        > Show or hide more information with the click of a button
        > Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it
        > Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage
        > Zooming in or zooming out on an image
        > Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
        > Playing audio and video in a web page
        > Displaying animations
        > Using a drop-down hamburger menu

        2. Creating web and mobile apps
        Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile
        apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide
        developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally
        a framework to build websites or web applications around. 

        Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many
        companies use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript
        V8 engine. A few famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!

        3. Building web servers and developing server applications
        Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and
        develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js. 

        4. Game development
        Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for
        beginning developers to practice their JavaScript skills.

    ### Question 02: Write a brief explanation of the following programming terms

    <br>

    ``` 
        > Compilers
            Answer -> The compiler is software that converts a program written in a high-level
            language (Source Language) to low-level language (Object/Target/Machine Language). 

        > Interpreters
            Answer -> An interpreter converts high-level language into low-level
            machine language, just like a compiler. But they are different in the way they read the
            input. The Compiler in one go reads the inputs, does the processing, and executes the
            source code whereas the interpreter does the same line by line. Compiler scans the entire
            program and translates it as a whole into machine code whereas an interpreter translates
            the program one statement at a time. Interpreted programs are usually slower with respect
            to compiled ones.

        > Translators
            Answer -> The most general term for a software code converting tool is “translator.” A
            translator, in software programming terms, is a generic term that could refer to a
            compiler, assembler, or interpreter; anything that converts higher level code into
            another high-level code (e.g., Basic, C++, Fortran, Java) or lower-level (i.e., a
            language that the processor can understand), such as assembly language or machine code.
            If you don’t know what the tool actually does other than that it accomplishes some level
            of code conversion to a specific target language, then you can safely call it a
            translator.

        > Assemblers
            Answer -> For every platform (Hardware +
            OS) we will have an assembler. They are
            not universal since for each platform we
            have one. The output of the assembler is
            called an object file. Its translates
            assembly language to machine code.

        > Programming paradigms
        > Debugging
        > Boolean
        > Char
        > Null
        > Command-line
        > Interface
        > Low-level language, High-level language
        Both High level language and low level language are the programming languages’s types.
        
        The main difference between high level
        language and low level language is that,
        Programmers can easily understand or interpret
        or compile the high level language in
        comparison of machine. On the other hand,
        Machine can easily understand the low level
        language in comparison of human beings.
        Examples of high level languages are C, C++,
        Java, Python, etc.
        
        > Markup language 
    ```

    ### Question 03: To understand the working principle of a website, research and write the following concepts
    ```
        > What are the differences between the Internet and an intranet?
        > What do the terms server-side and client-side mean?
        > What is a server and how does it work?
        > What is a domain and how does it work?
        > What is HTTP and why do you need it?
        > Explain the differences between URL and URI expressions.
